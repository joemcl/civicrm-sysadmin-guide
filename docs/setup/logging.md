# Undelete, Logging and ReCAPTCHA - PDF Receipts, Version Checking, CAPTCHA, Link Lifespan, Contact Delete, Attachments, & other Misc. Settings


**The screen at CiviCRM › Administer CiviCRM › Settings - Undelete, Logging and ReCAPTCHA contains a number of miscellaneous global settings for CiviCRM:**

* **Dashboard cache timeout** - The number of minutes to cache dashlet content on dashboard.
* **CheckSum Lifespan** - The number of days before a personalized (hashed) link will expire.
* **Contact Trash & Undelete** - If enabled, deleted contacts will be moved to trash (instead of being destroyed). Users with the proper permission are able to search for the deleted contacts and restore them (or delete permanently).
* **Logging** - If enabled, all actions performed on non-cache tables will be logged (in the respective log_* tables). A message indicates: _Logging functionality is currently in beta. Please test this feature on a copy of your database prior to using it on a production site._ More details about logging and how it works:
    * Enabling logging will not destroy or change your existing data. However it will add many new tables to your database–one new table for most existing CiviCRM tables in the database, each with a log_ prefix.
    * In these tables the logging system will store the initial values of your current CiviCRM tables and then each time a row is added, deleted, or changed to your existing tables, the new row will be added to the log_ table along with extra fields showing the time, user who made the change, and type of change.
    * It is suggested to create a new database and then edit your civicrm.settings.php file to add information for the new logging database there, under CIVICRM_LOGGING_DSN. If you create a new database called mydatabase_civicrm_logging the line in civicrm.settings.php might look similar to this:
        ```php
        define( 'CIVICRM_LOGGING_DSN' , 'mysql://sqlusername:sqlpassword@localhost/mydatabase_civicrm_logging?new_link=true' );
       
        ```

    * _<u><b>Before creating this new database for the logging tables or turning logging on in the admin menu, be sure to make a complete backup copy of your existing database.</b></u>_
    * When you enable logging, your civicrm database user must have authority to create triggers. If your database user does not have proper authority you will see a generic DB error message when enabling logging. You may need to create a new DB user with the necessary authority and use that DB account when running civicrm.
    * A rundown of how the logging system works is in this article: [http://civicrm.org/blogs/shot/new-civicrm-33-feature-logging](http://civicrm.org/blogs/shot/new-civicrm-33-feature-logging)
    * The reporting system is still definitely in beta in CiviCRM 4.2. In 4.2, the example contact report templates, mentioned in the article above, are not automatically created. However, two contribution logging reports are available–looking under Reports/Reports Listing.
    * You can create the two contact logging reports, mentioned in the article above, in Administer/CiviReport/Manage Templates with these values for the Logging Summary Report:

        * URL: /contact/loggingsummary
        * Class: CRM_Report_Form_Contact_LoggingSummary

        And these values for the Detail Report:
       
        * URL: /contact/loggingdetail
        * Class: CRM_Report_Form_Contact_LoggingDetail

        * Then go to Administer/CiviReport/Create Reports from Templates and create the Contact Logging (summary) report. That report works but the links to the detail report may not. You may be able to get the detail report to work, by adding "&force=1" to the URL of the detail report. See [http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php?topic=18503.0](http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php?topic=18503.0) but These reports are definitely in beta quality as of CiviCRM 4.2.2.

    * You can download an Extension with extended reports for logging that provides basic functionality for contact changes and takes the place of the two contact reports mentioned above. Download the extension here: [http://civicrm.org/extensions/extended-logging-report/version-10-0](http://civicrm.org/extensions/extended-logging-report/version-10-0) and install by following the instructions here: [Extensions](/customize/extensions.md). Once installed, create report templates at Administer/CiviReport/Manage Templates with these values:

        * URL: contact/extendedloggingsummary
        * Class: CRM_Extendedloggingreports_Form_Report_CRM_extendedloggingreports_Report_Form_Contact_LoggingSummary

        * URL: contact/extendedloggingdetail
        * Class: CRM_Extendedloggingreports_Form_Report_CRM_extendedloggingreports_Report_Form_Contact_LoggingDetail

    * Then go to Administer/CiviReport/Create Reports from Templates and create a report from the Summary template. You won't need to create a report from the Detail template because it is access from the Summary template. Using the URLs above when you create the templates is the key to getting the summary report to link to the detail report successfully.

* **Attach PDF copy to receipts** - If enabled, CiviCRM sends PDF receipt as an attachment during event signup or online contribution.
* **Path to wkhtmltopdf executable** - [wkhtmltopdf](http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/) is an alternative utility for generating PDF's which may provide better performance especially if you are generating a large number of PDF letters or receipts. Your system administrator will need to download and install this utility, and enter the executable path here.
* **Version Check & Statistics Reporting** - If enabled, CiviCRM automatically checks availablity of a newer version of the software. New version alerts will be displayed on the main CiviCRM Administration page.
* When enabled, statistics about your CiviCRM installation are reported anonymously to the CiviCRM team to assist in prioritizing ongoing development efforts. The following information is gathered: CiviCRM version, versions of PHP, MySQL and framework (Drupal/Joomla/standalone), and default language. Counts (but no actual data) of the following record types are reported: contacts, activities, cases, relationships, contributions, contribution pages, contribution products, contribution widgets, discounts, price sets, profiles, events, participants, tell-a-friend pages, grants, mailings, memberships, membership blocks, pledges, pledge blocks and active payment processor types.
* **Maximum Attachments** - Maximum number of files (documents, images, etc.) which can attached to emails or activities.
* **Maximum File Size (in MB)** - Maximum Size of file (documents, images, etc.) which can attached to emails or activities. Note: php.ini should support this file size.
* **CiviCRM Version Check** - Indicate if you want CiviCRM to automatically check availablity of a newer version of the software. If enabled, new version alerts will be displayed on the main CiviCRM Administration page.
* **Captcha Font** - Enter a Filename for a suitable true-type font (*.ttf) to render the CAPTCHA image.

**IMPORTANT: A valid CAPTCHA font and path are required if you have enabled the CAPTCHA feature for any of your CiviCRM Profile input forms.**

**Captcha Font Path** - Indicate the absolute file-system path to the directory where the CAPTCHA font file is located.

Click **Save** to save your action or **Cancel** to cancel it.

If successful you will see the message "Your changes have been saved."
